# Theory vs. Practice

- List 3 reasons why asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to
  actual performance in practice.
    1. Asymptotic analysis doesn't take into account constant factors. So while the constant factors do take time to run or memory to store, they aren't analysed. 
    2. Asymptotic analysis doesn't take into account for the uniqueness of different implementations, for example some implemetations might use less memory than others and while this doesn't change anything for the asymptotic analysis it can effect actual run time of algorithms.
    3.   

- Suppose finding a particular element in a binary search tree with 1,000
  elements takes 5 seconds. Given what you know about the asymptotic complexity
  of search in a binary search tree, how long would you guess finding the same
  element in a search tree with 10,000 elements takes? Explain your reasoning.

- You measure the time with 10,000 elements and it takes 100 seconds! List 3
  reasons why this could be the case, given that reasoning with the asymptotic
  complexity suggests a different time.
